Geoportail.lu API Documentation Examples
============

This is a list of script examples of using the GeoAPI of the Geoportail.lu. These examples show some of the functionality available. 

All examples will run fine under localhost, but if you want to use these examples on a specific domain, you will need to request access to the ACT (support.geoportail@act.etat.lu), specifying the server address you wish to grant access too.
